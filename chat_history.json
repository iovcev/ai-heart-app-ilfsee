You want to build a mobile chat application called \"AI Companion\" where users can chat with an AI designed for emotional connection and light flirting. Here's a plan to get started with the React Native and Expo 54 app:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n*   **Chat Interface:** A clean and modern chat UI with message bubbles, timestamps, and a typing animation.\n*   **AI Integration:** Connect to an LLM API (like OpenAI) to generate responses based on user input. The AI should adapt its tone based on a selected personality.\n*   **User Customization:** Allow users to choose their AI companion's name, gender, avatar, and personality type.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F0F5` (Light Rose)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#E91E63` (Rose Pink)\n    *   Secondary: `#9C27B0` (Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#F06292` (Light Pink)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF4081` (Bright Pink)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"Poppins\" for a friendly and readable experience.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Set up the basic chat interface:** Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory for the chat interface. This screen will include:\n    *   An input field for users to type messages.\n    *   A display area for showing the conversation history.\n    *   Styling for message bubbles, timestamps, and typing animation.\n2.  **Implement User Customization:**\n    *   Add a screen or modal where users can customize their AI companion's name, gender, avatar, and personality type.\n    *   Store these settings locally for now.\n3.  **Integrate with OpenAI (or another LLM):**\n    *   Create a function that takes user input and sends it to the OpenAI API.\n    *   Process the response from the API and display it in the chat interface.\n    *   Implement basic emotion detection and tone adaptation based on the selected personality.\n4.  **Modify the app/(tabs) folder:**\n    *   Add the new chat screen to the tab navigation.\n    *   Ensure seamless navigation between the home screen, profile screen, and the new chat screen.\n    *   Make sure the changes are visible for the user.\n5.  **Remove the modalDemos array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is no longer needed.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-27T06:47:39.492339"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this AI Companion chat application!

The app uses `AsyncStorage` to save settings, so it's crucial to ensure that `AsyncStorage` is correctly configured and that the save functions are working as expected.\n\nHere's a plan to address these issues:\n\n1.  **Inspect `useApiKey` and `useCompanionSettings` hooks:** Verify that these hooks are correctly using `AsyncStorage` to save and retrieve data. Check for any errors during the save operations.\n2.  **Review `handleSaveSettings` function:** Ensure that this function is actually being called when the \"Save Settings\" button is pressed. Add console logs to confirm that the API key and companion settings are being saved to `AsyncStorage`.\n3.  **Check the Chat Screen:** Verify that the chat screen is correctly retrieving the API key and companion settings from `AsyncStorage`. Ensure that the `generateResponse` function in the `useOpenAI` hook is being called with the correct parameters.\n4.  **Debug OpenAI API Integration:** Check for any errors when calling the OpenAI API.

Now let me create a comprehensive summary of the changes I've made to fix the issues:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've identified and fixed the core issues with your AI Companion app. The main problems were:\n\n### **Issues Found:**\n\n1. **Settings not saving**: The settings screen was using local state that was initialized before the AsyncStorage hooks finished loading data. This meant the form fields were empty even when data existed in storage.\n\n2. **API key not persisting**: Same issue - the API key input field wasn't syncing with the loaded value from AsyncStorage.\n\n3. **Chat not starting**: The chat screen wasn't properly checking for the API key or handling the loading states, which could cause issues when trying to send messages.\n\n### **Fixes Applied:**\n\n#### 1. **Enhanced `useApiKey` hook** (`hooks/useApiKey.ts`)\n- Added comprehensive console logging to track save/load operations\n- Added error handling with throw statements to propagate errors\n- Better debugging capabilities\n\n#### 2. **Enhanced `useCompanionSettings` hook** (`hooks/useCompanionSettings.ts`)\n- Added comprehensive console logging\n- Added error handling with throw statements\n- Better debugging capabilities\n\n#### 3. **Fixed Settings Screen** (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`)\n- Added `useEffect` hooks to sync local state with hook values when they finish loading\n- Added loading indicator while data is being loaded from AsyncStorage\n- Added saving indicator to show when settings are being saved\n- Proper error handling with try-catch blocks\n- Console logs to track the save process\n\n#### 4. **Fixed Chat Screen** (`app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`)\n- Added loading state handling for all hooks\n- Added loading indicator while data is being loaded\n- Enhanced error handling and user feedback\n- Added API key warning on empty state\n- Better console logging for debugging\n- Disabled input while AI is generating response\n- Added visual feedback (ActivityIndicator) when sending messages\n\n### **Key Changes:**\n\n**Settings Screen:**\n```typescript\n// Now properly syncs with loaded data\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (!settingsLoading) {\n    setName(settings.name);\n    setGender(settings.gender);\n    setPersonality(settings.personality);\n    setAvatar(settings.avatar);\n  }\n}, [settingsLoading, settings]);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (!apiKeyLoading) {\n    setApiKeyInput(apiKey);\n  }\n}, [apiKeyLoading, apiKey]);\n```\n\n**Chat Screen:**\n```typescript\n// Now waits for data to load before rendering\nif (messagesLoading || settingsLoading || apiKeyLoading) {\n  return <LoadingIndicator />;\n}\n\n// Better error handling\ntry {\n  await saveSettings(newSettings);\n  await saveApiKey(apiKeyInput.trim());\n  Alert.alert('Success', 'Settings saved successfully!');\n} catch (error) {\n  Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to save settings. Please try again.');\n}\n```\n\n### **Testing the Fixes:**\n\nTo verify everything is working:\n\n1. **Open the app** - It should load the welcome screen or home screen based on whether you have an API key\n2. **Go to Settings** - You should see a loading indicator briefly, then your current settings\n3. **Enter an API key** - Type in your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)\n4. **Customize your companion** - Change name, personality, avatar\n5. **Click \"Save Settings\"** - You should see a success alert\n6. **Close and reopen the app** - Your settings should persist\n7. **Go to Chat** - Try sending a message - it should work now\n8. **Check the console** - You should see detailed logs about what's happening\n\nThe app now properly:\n- \u2705 Saves API key to AsyncStorage\n- \u2705 Saves companion settings to AsyncStorage\n- \u2705 Loads saved data on app restart\n- \u2705 Shows loading states while data is loading\n- \u2705 Provides clear error messages\n- \u2705 Handles chat interactions properly\n- \u2705 Validates API key format\n- \u2705 Shows visual feedback during operations\n\nAll the persistence issues should now be resolved!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-27T07:09:42Z"}]
