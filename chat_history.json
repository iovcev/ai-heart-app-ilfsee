You want to build a mobile chat application called \"AI Companion\" where users can chat with an AI designed for emotional connection and light flirting. Here's a plan to get started with the React Native and Expo 54 app:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n*   **Chat Interface:** A clean and modern chat UI with message bubbles, timestamps, and a typing animation.\n*   **AI Integration:** Connect to an LLM API (like OpenAI) to generate responses based on user input. The AI should adapt its tone based on a selected personality.\n*   **User Customization:** Allow users to choose their AI companion's name, gender, avatar, and personality type.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F0F5` (Light Rose)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#E91E63` (Rose Pink)\n    *   Secondary: `#9C27B0` (Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#F06292` (Light Pink)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF4081` (Bright Pink)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"Poppins\" for a friendly and readable experience.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Set up the basic chat interface:** Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory for the chat interface. This screen will include:\n    *   An input field for users to type messages.\n    *   A display area for showing the conversation history.\n    *   Styling for message bubbles, timestamps, and typing animation.\n2.  **Implement User Customization:**\n    *   Add a screen or modal where users can customize their AI companion's name, gender, avatar, and personality type.\n    *   Store these settings locally for now.\n3.  **Integrate with OpenAI (or another LLM):**\n    *   Create a function that takes user input and sends it to the OpenAI API.\n    *   Process the response from the API and display it in the chat interface.\n    *   Implement basic emotion detection and tone adaptation based on the selected personality.\n4.  **Modify the app/(tabs) folder:**\n    *   Add the new chat screen to the tab navigation.\n    *   Ensure seamless navigation between the home screen, profile screen, and the new chat screen.\n    *   Make sure the changes are visible for the user.\n5.  **Remove the modalDemos array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is no longer needed.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-27T06:47:39.492339"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this AI Companion chat application!
